# Rust Learning Project

This repository is for my personal practice and learning of the Rust programming language, following along with [The Rust Programming Language book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/).

## About

This project serves as a space to experiment with code examples and exercises from the Rust book. It's a hands-on approach to solidify my understanding of Rust concepts and build practical skills.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, you will need to have Rust installed on your system. If you haven't already, you can install Rust by following the instructions on the [official Rust website](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

### Prerequisites

- Rust toolchain (including `rustc` and `cargo`)

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone [repository-url]
   cd [repository-name]
   ```

### Running

Each chapter or section of the book might correspond to a separate project or module within this repository. Navigate to the specific directory for the code you want to run and use `cargo` commands.

For example, to build and run a project in a subdirectory named `chapter01`:
